#
# Deployment Manager template for running MongoDB on a cluster of servers.
#
# The MongoDB deployment here consists of three separate replica pools:
#  * Deployment Coordinator
#  * MongoDB server instances
#  * MongoDB arbiter instances
#
# The Deployment Coordinator exists to provide functionality
# otherwise unavailable from the Deployment Manager infrastructure.
# For example Deployment Manager is currently unable to
# monitor the software installation part of a deployment.
#
# The MongoDB server instances are the data-bearing instances.
# The MongoDB arbiter instances are NOT data-bearing instances.
#
# A common MongoDB replicaset deployment will have three instances:
#  * Two data-bearing instances to serve as a primary and secondary
#  * One arbiter instance to vote in primary elections
